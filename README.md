=========

FTC 4029 repository for the 2014-2015 season. 

Do NOT place test files in here. Keep them in the non-version-controlled Documents/Programming/test folder.


Using a container struct for data and prefixing functions with the module name will prevent pollution of the global namespace. Although verbose, this will allow modules to be more independent. 

Style
=====
####Variables:
Different words in variables are separated by underscores. e.g. `int current_speed`. 

####Functions:
Function names are written with camelCase. e.g. `moveForward()`. 

####Modules:
For both TeleOp and Autonomous
